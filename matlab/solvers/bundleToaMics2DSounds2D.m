%Bundling TOA measurements with paris of microphones located on rigid constellations, with
%constnat, unknown distances between the paired microphones. ALl rigs has the same
%unknown inter distance. Futhermore, Sounds are in 3D and Microphones in
%an affine subspace of dimension 2, here assumed to be the x-y plane. Thus,
%before bundling, one has to rotate-translate the cosntellation of
%mics/sounds so that the microphones has coordinates z=0.
%Mic1, xt(:,1)is assumed to be on a rig with Mic2, xt(:,2)
%Mic3, xt(:,3)is assumed to be on a rig with Mic4, xt(:,4)
